Body temperature is significantly different (t = 11.536, p < 0.001) between men and women (95% CI does not include zero, therefore we can accept the null hypothesis regarding body temperature).\n\n## Question 2\n\n**Alternative hypothesis:** Handedness is associated with ataxic walking in intoxicated individuals.\n\n**Null hypothesis:** There is no association between handedness and ataxic walking in intoxicated individuals.\n\n```{r question_2, warning=FALSE}\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n# Import data\ndata2 <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/exam-data-2016/question2.csv')\n# Summary statistics\nsummary(data2)\nhead(data2)\n# Select a subset of columns\nselect <- select(data2, handedness, final_position)\n# Cross tabulate selected columns\ntab <- xtabs(~ handedness + final_position, data = select)\ntab\n# Plot data\nbarplot(tab, beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE)\n# Statistical test\nmcnemar.test(tab)\n```\n\n**Type of data:** Paired ordinal data.\n\n**Test Assumptions:**\n\n* The two groups are mutually independent.\n* Each x and y can be assigned to two possible categories.\n* Random sampling.\n\n\n**Statistical test:** McNemar Test\n\n**Test statistic:**\n\nChi-squared = 1.0159\nDegrees of freedom = 1\nSample size = 151\np = 0.3135\n\n**Conclusion:** There is no significant association (Chi-squared = 1.0159, p = 0.3135) between handedness and ataxic walking in intoxicated individuals.\n\n## Question 3\n\n**Alternative hypothesis:** Running time is associated with calories consumed during a run.\n\n**Null hypothesis:** There is no association between running time and calorie consumption.\n\n```{r question_3, warning=FALSE}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n# Import dataset\ndata3 <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/exam-data-2016/question3.csv')\n# Summary statistics\nsummary(data3)\nhead(data3)\n# Exploratory plot (modified to publishable format)\nplot(data3$time, data3$calories, xlab = 'Running time (s)', ylab = 'Calories consumed (cal)', main = 'Correlation between running time and calories consumed during run.')\n# Abline of linear regression\nabline(lm(calories ~ time, data = data3))\n\n# Test for correlation \ncor.test(data3$time, data3$calories, method = 'pearson')\n# Linear regression analysis\nmodel <- lm(calories ~ time, data = data3)\n# Print summary of linear regression statistics\nsummary(model)\n# Diagnostic plots to confirm linear regression\nplot(x = model$fitted, y = model$residuals)\nabline(h = 0)\nqqnorm(model$residuals)\nqqline(model$residuals)\n```\n\n**Type of data:** Unpaired continuous data.\n\n**Assumptions for Pearson's correlation:** \n\n* There is a linear relationship between the variables.\n* There are no outliers\n* Both variables are approximately normally distributed.\n\n**Assumptions for linear regression:**\n\n* There is a linear trend between x and y.\n* The observations in the sample are independent.\n* x is measured without error.\n* The residuals are normally distributed.\n* The residuals have the same variance for all fitted values of y (homoskedastic).\n\n**Statistical test:** Pearson's correlation and linear regression model.\n\n**Results:**\n\n_Correlation analysis_\nPearson's t = -3.77\nDegrees of freedom = 17\np = 0.0015\n95% Confidence Interval = -0.86 to -0.32\n\n_Linear regression_\nF-statistic = 14.22\nDegrees of freedom = 17\np = 0.0015\n\nThe graph fitted for homoskedacity shows no pattern, therefore the residuals have the same variance for all fitted values of y. \nThe quantile-quantile plot showed a Gaussian distribution of the residuals. \n\n**Conclusion:** There is a significant inverse relationship (t = -3.77, F = 14.22, p = 0.0015) between running time and the calories consumed during a run.\n\n## Question 4\n\n```{r question_4, warning=FALSE, dev='pdf', fig.path='./figures/'}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nfoo <- rnorm(10000, mean = 60, sd = 3) # final mark\nbar <- rnorm(10000, mean = 68, sd = 5) # project mark\nbaz <- rep(seq(from = 1997, to = 2006), each = 1) # years\n\nyear <- sample(baz, 150, replace = TRUE,\n               prob = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.08, 0.08, \n                          0.1, 0.13, 0.14, 0.13, 0.12, 0.12))\nproject_mark <- sample(bar, 150, replace = TRUE)\nfinal_mark <- sample(foo, 150, replace = TRUE)\n\nplot_data <- data_frame(year = year,\n                        project_mark = round(project_mark, 1),\n                        final_mark = round(final_mark, 1)) %>%\n    arrange(year)\nplot(plot_data$project_mark, plot_data$final_mark, xlab = 'Project mark (%)', ylab = 'Final mark (%)', main = 'Relationship between project mark and final mark.', ylim = c(50, 80), xlim = c(50, 80))\n# Axis scale was set from 50 to 80 because the distribution and trend of the marks is easier to see.\n```\n\n",
